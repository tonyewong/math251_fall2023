We can use a new argument, called `prob`, to assign different probabilities to different outcomes. For example, we could represent 5 flips of a coin that is biased so that Heads appears 3/4 of the time as follows.\n","```\n","sample(c(\"Heads\",\"Tails), prob=c(3/4, 1/4), size=5)\n","```\n","\n","Replace each instance of `???` with code that will complete the desired tasks. Be sure to also change `num_samples` to be appropriately large to get a good estimate of the final probability, $P(B_1 \\mid R)$, which we saw earlier should come out to about 0.645."],"metadata":{"id":"kcQx8dShPXOh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["num_samples = 10  # how many samples do we want to use?\n","num_R = 0         # initialize a counter for how many times Artemis picks Red\n","num_R_B1 = 0      # initialize a counter for how many times Artemis picks Red AND from Box 1\n","\n","for (i in 1:num_samples) {\n","  box = sample(c(1,2), size=1)   # a single trial of picking a box totally at random\n","  if (box==1) {\n","    color = sample(c(\"R\",\"G\"), prob=c(???,???), size=1)  # given picking from Box 1, what color does she pick?\n","  } else if (box==2) {\n","    color = sample(c(\"R\",\"G\"), prob=c(???,???), size=1)  # given picking from Box 2, what color does she pick?\n","  }\n","  if (color==\"R\") {\n","    num_R = ???      # if ball is Red, add 1 to the count for how many Reds\n","  }\n","  if (color==\"R\" && box==1) {\n","    num_R_B1 = ???   # if ball is Red and picking from Box 1, add 1 to that count\n","  }\n","}\n","Pr_R_and_B1 = ???    # estimate P(Red and Box 1)\n","Pr_R = ???           # estimate P(Red)\n","Pr_B1_given_R = ???  # estimate P(Box 1 | R)\n","print(Pr_B1_given_R)"],"metadata":{"id":"88qT-CZ8Pzw0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# SOLUTION:\n","\n","num_samples = 10000  # how many samples do we want to use?\n","num_R = 0         # initialize a counter for how many times Artemis picks Red\n","num_R_B1 = 0      # initialize a counter for how many times Artemis picks Red AND from Box 1\n","\n","for (i in 1:num_samples) {\n","  box = sample(c(1,2), size=1)   # a single trial of picking a box totally at random\n","  if (box==1) {\n","    color = sample(c(\"R\",\"G\"), prob=c(7/9,2/9), size=1)  # given picking from Box 1, what color does she pick?\n","  } else if (box==2) {\n","    color = sample(c(\"R\",\"G\"), prob=c(3/7,4/7), size=1)  # given picking from Box 2, what color does she pick?\n","  }\n","  if (color==\"R\") {\n","    num_R = num_R+1      # if ball is Red, add 1 to the count for how many Reds\n","  }\n","  if (color==\"R\" && box==1) {\n","    num_R_B1 = num_R_B1+1   # if ball is Red and picking from Box 1, add 1 to that count\n","  }\n","}\n","Pr_R_and_B1 = num_R_B1/num_samples    # estimate P(Red and Box 1)\n","Pr_R = num_R/num_samples           # estimate P(Red)\n","Pr_B1_given_R = Pr_R_and_B1/Pr_R  # estimate P(Box 1 | R)\n","print(Pr_B1_given_R)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"v_F4fKYcQvIl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1692648907634,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10973,"user":{"displayName":"Tony Wong","userId":"17263992049051874760"}},"outputId":"2fcd4269-e9ef-4ca4-9d06-794d6976f9a7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1] 0.6461896\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"cJFAF-TEQ4vk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
