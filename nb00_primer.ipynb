When you create your own Jupyter notebooks, this is a handy way to organize your work.\n","* Click the X in the upper-right of the left-hand menu to close it and reclaim a larger portion of your screen for your glorious notebook.\n","* Just like with Google Docs, your changes are *generally* all saved. You can view these waypoints and changes by clicking `File` > `Revision history`.\n","* Note, however, that the frequency with which Google auto-saves the notebook might not match how often _you_ want to save your work (say, after you complete a tough section). Also, it is always good to manually save every once in a while to make sure (1) you're still connected to your Google Drive and (2) you're still connected to the internet. It doesn't happen often, but if it does and you lose a bunch of work, that's a very frustrating experience."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Amz7R2_TgLcx"},"source":["## 8 So what do I do with these coding labs?\n","\n","Now there's a good question!\n","\n","These labs are meant to introduce how the concepts we learn in the classroom play out in real-world coding and data-driven applications. You will notice that there are a number **Task ##:** subsubsection labels peppered throughout the notebook. I format them as subsubsections so that you'll see where they all are in the Table of contents (see [Section 7](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wTcPaNt38RBViv6UxeH-053QxZdigY_I?authuser=1#scrollTo=6F-TxAkzfy5m&line=6&uniqifier=1) above). Your job is to make sure you answer all of these questions, then hand in your Jupyter notebook as a Lecture Work assignment (I'll let you know which ones). Easy as that!\n","\n","Some finer details:\n","* Show any/all relevant work.\n","* Put you and your group members' names at the top of the notebook.\n","* Download the file as a PDF by clicking `File > Print` and then selecting `Save as PDF` (this may differ depending on whether you're using a Windows/Mac/Linux computer).\n","* Each member of your group should submit a completed PDF version of the notebook (**with everyone's names on it at the top**) to the myCourses dropbox.\n","* Note that you can also download the file as an actual Jupyter notebook (as opposed to human-readable document) by clicking `File > Download > Download .ipynb`. But, so we can grade them more easily, please only submit PDF files to the myCourses dropboxes.\n","* If the PDF export looks terrible or is cut off (sometimes this happens), try using this app:  https://htmtopdf.herokuapp.com/ipynbviewer/\n","* Submit the exported PDF to Gradescope, and be sure to do **BOTH** of the following:\n","  * **add all group members to the Gradescope submission**\n","  * **use Gradescope's features at submission to link where each problem is in your uploaded PDF**\n","  * failure to do either of these will result in a loss of points\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tFQtJjl4kA-T"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
